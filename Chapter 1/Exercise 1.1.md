**1.1-1: *Describe your own real-world example that requires sorting. Describe one that requires finding the shortest distance between two points.***

Answer: One might sort all available grocery stores within a certain distance by how far away they are.

**1.1-2: *Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might you need to consider in a real-world setting?***

Answer: Memory efficiency and complexity.

**1.1-3: *Select a data structure that you have seen, and discuss its strengths and limitations.***

Answer: For example a queue. The structure guarantees that the elements retain their internal ordering. Inserting and removing from a queue is fast, but accessing random elements isn't.

**1.1-4: *How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesperson problems given above similar? How are they different?***

Answer: The traveling salesperson problem requires you to visit a number of points in the most efficient manner, but the shortest-path problem always involes only two points and then tries to find the shortest path between these. The shortest-path problem is basically the traveling salesperson problem with a restricted amount of destinations.

**1.1-5: *Suggest a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which approximately the best solution is good enough.***

Answer: Sorting is a good example of a problem where it is either correct or not. If one book is out of place in a bookshelf, it isn't sorted. However, when travelling between many locations like in the travelling salesperson problem, an approximate solution is still very good (obviously, since we in most cases don't have time to calculate the best possible solution as discussed in the chapter).

**1.1-6: *Describe a real-world problem in which sometimes the entire input is available before you need to solve the problem, but other times the input is not entirely available in advance and arrives over time.***

Answer: Picking a movie to watch. Sometimes you might have a few DVD's and no internet, but other times you continuously discover more movies while trying to choose a suitable one.
